# About
dwjloc was developd to be a management system for a tool rent company, but was never used because of the lack of Java servers. It's primary functionality was to manage tool rents, calculate prices based on rent time and notify delays. It also provides a login and access control system with configurable access levels, rent history along with user and stock management.

# Notes
This was the course assignment for my Java web college lectures.

# Running
This honestly can be a HUGE pain. If you use Intellij Idea Professional, you can set it up to run with Tomcat 7 and it should be smooth sailing. Else, Tomcat gave a lot of trouble with eclipse and I just don't recomend it. The database will be generated.
